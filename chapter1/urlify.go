/*
  URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may
  assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
  characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
  Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
  perform this operation in place.)
  EXAMPLE
  Input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
  Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

  Hint #58: Try thinking about the array as circular, such that the end of the
  array "wraps around" to the start of the array.

  Hint #118: You might find you need to know the number of spaces. Can you
  just count them?
