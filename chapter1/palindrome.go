/*
  Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a
  permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same
  forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.

  The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

  EXAMPLE
  Input: Tact Coa
  Output: True (permutations: "taco cat". "atco cta". etc.)

  Hint #106: You do not have to-and should not-generate all permutations. This
  would be very inefficient.

  Hint #121: What characteristics would a string that is a permutation of a
  palindrome have?

  Hint #134: Have you tried a hash table? You should be able to get this down
  to 0 (N) time.

  Hint #136: Can you reduce the space usage by using a bit vector? 1
