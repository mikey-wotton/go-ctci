/*
  Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0,
  its entire row and column are set to O.
  Hints: # 17, #74, #102

  Hint #17: If you just cleared the rows and columns as you found Os, you'd
  likely wind up clearing the whole matrix. Try finding the cells with zeros
  first before making any changes to the matrix.

  Hint #74: Can you use O(N) additional space instead of O(N2)? What
  information do you really need from the list of cells that are zero?

  Hint #102: You probably need some data storage to maintain a list of the rows
  and columns that need to be zeroed. Can you reduce the additional space usage
  to a (1) by using the matrix itself for data storage?
