/*

  Hint #1: Describe what it means for two strings to be permutations of each other.
  Now, look at that definition you provided. Can you check the strings against
  that definition?

  Hint #84: There is one solution that is 0 (N log N) time. Another solution
  uses some space, but isO(N) time

  Hint #122: Could a hash table be useful?

  Hint #131: Can you do all three checks in a single pass?
