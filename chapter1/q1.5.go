/*
  One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings:
  insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two
  strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
  EXAMPLE
  pale, ple -> true
  pales, pale -> true
  pale, bale -> true
  pale, bake -> false

  Hint #23: Start with the easy thing. Can you check each of the conditions
  separately?

  Hint #97: What is the relationship between the "insert character" option and
  the "remove character" option? Do these need to be two separate checks?

  Hint #130: Can you do all three checks in a single pass?
