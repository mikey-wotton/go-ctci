  Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
  cannot use additional data structures?
  Hints: #44, #117, #132

  Hint #44: Try a hash table.

  Hint #117: Could a bit vector be useful?

  Hint #132: Can you solve it in O(N log N) time? What might a solution like that look like?
